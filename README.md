### Machine-Learning-Models

### Learning objectives I
Gain an introduction to the pandas library
Understand the main steps involved in training a machine learning model
Gain an introduction to scikit-learn's API
Understand the need to generate a training and validation set

### Learning objectives II
Understand the conceptual difference between bagging and boosting ensembles
Understand how gradient boosting works for regression tasks
Learn how to tune the key hyperparameters of gradient boosting ensembles

### What is gradient boosting?
Boosting refers to an ensemble technique that combines multiple simple or "weak" models into a single composite model. Unlike the bagging method we saw in previous lessons, boosting methods train the models sequentially, where each model is chosen to improve the overall performance.
